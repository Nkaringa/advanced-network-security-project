# c2_test_commands.txt
# Simulated Command & Control (C2) traffic from Windows victim machine

# 1. Attempt to contact a fake C2 server on TCP port 4444
#    This traffic is expected to be BLOCKED by pfSense and/or logged by Suricata.
curl http://10.10.10.101:4444/beacon

# 2. Alternative using PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest:
# Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://10.10.10.101:4444/beacon" -UseBasicParsing

# These commands were used to:
#   - Validate that C2-like outbound traffic is blocked by firewall rules.
#   - Confirm that Suricata raises alerts for suspicious outbound connections.
